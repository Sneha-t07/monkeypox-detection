# Monkeypox Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses the InceptionV3 model to classify skin images as Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, or Normal. 
# NOTE: 
 This project is adapted from a public deep learning tutorial on skin disease classification. I have adapted and extended the work for learning purposes.

## Files
- `monkeypox_detection.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook
- `model.h5`: Trained Keras model (optional)
- `images/`: Sample test images

## Dataset
Dataset used: Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset (Open Source)

## Accuracy
Achieved over 98% accuracy in multi-class classification.
